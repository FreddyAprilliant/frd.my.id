Hi, my name is Fredi Apriliyanto
{.h1 .text-center}
This is my "*documentation-like*" site where I jot down all my DevOps adventures—projects, experiments, and the occasional lightbulb moment (or misfire). I don't know what I'm doing (*no joke*) but try my best to understand everything i did and write 'em down as much as i can. So, i could revisit them whenever i want.
